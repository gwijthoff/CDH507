</h3>

This graduate course provides a foundation in the history, concepts, methodologies, and tools of digital humanities research. Students learn to critically evaluate and incorporate computational and data-driven methods into their research, and achieve a baseline fluency in accessing, filtering, and analyzing humanities datasets. No prerequisites or preexisting technical skills are required. Students working with texts, images, and artifacts are welcome. Enrollment preference will be given to students pursuing in the [Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/engage/graduate-students/graduate-certificate/).

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, students will:

- Gain fluency in the current landscape of platforms, tools, and techniques for computational and data-driven research in the humanities. In particular, students learn the basics of the command line, GitHub, and Jupyter (Python) notebooks.
- Locate their home discipline within the wider galaxy of humanistic inquiry. How do the interaction of quantitative methods and data science impact their field, as well as the humanities at large?
- Learn about the rise of so-called "artificial intelligence" in the world today, and what interventions humanities researchers offer the way these technologies construe meaning.
- Prepare a research plan for a DH project, either as a conference presentation, a dissertation chapter, a standalone research article, or a curated dataset.
- Read recent scholarship spanning history, literary studies, art history, and other humanities disciplines engaged in the use of computational methods.
