This graduate course provides a foundation in the history, concepts, methodologies, and tools of digital humanities research. Students learn to critically evaluate and incorporate computational and data-driven methods into their research, and achieve a baseline fluency in accessing, filtering, and analyzing humanities datasets. No prerequisites or preexisting technical skills are required. Students working with texts, images, and artifacts are welcome. Enrollment preference will be given to students pursuing in the [Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities](https://cdh.princeton.edu/engage/graduate-students/graduate-certificate/).

### Learning Outcomes

In this class, students will:

- Gain fluency in the current landscape of platforms, tools, and techniques for computational and data-driven research in the humanities. In particular, students learn the basics of the command line, and Jupyter (Python) notebooks, and QGIS.
- Locate their home discipline within the wider galaxy of humanistic inquiry. How are quantitative methods and data science impacting their field, as well as the humanities writ large?
- Learn about the rise of so-called "artificial intelligence" in the world today and what interventions humanities researchers offer the way these technologies construe meaning.
- Prepare a research plan for a DH project, either as a conference presentation, a dissertation chapter, a standalone research article, or a curated dataset.
- Read ~70-100pp / week of recent scholarship spanning history, literary studies, art history, and other humanities disciplines engaged in the use of computational methods.

### Assignments

Assignments for the course include:

- 40% | Short prospectus for a DH research project related to the student's discipline in the form of a mock grant proposal. Proposal should include elements like a bibliography, a speculative, ten-line sample of a dataset, the teaching potential of that data, and the kinds of research questions it would enable. The proposed project does not need to be fully enacted during the course, but can eventually take the form of a conference talk, dissertation chapter, article, or dataset.
- 30% | Completion of hands-on exercises with DH tools & methods. Work will be done both in and out of class.
- 30% | Discussion contributions before, during, and after class; attendance.
