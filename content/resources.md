## Examples of Humanities Research Using AI & ML üß™

DeepMind's [Ithaca](https://github.com/deepmind/ithaca), a project using AI to restore and attribute texts from Ancient Greece using neural networks as an aid to epigraphy.

MIT researchers using AI to [decode the still-undeciphered Indus script](https://restofworld.org/2022/indus-translation-ai-code-script/). The paper [published in *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1170391) concludes that the script is likely not just symbols, but language.

[AEOLIAN (Artificial Intelligence for Cultural Organisations)](https://www.aeolian-network.net/), including [this writeup](https://www.aeolian-network.net/case-study-2-computer-vision-and-cultural-heritage/) on use of AI with medieval manuscripts.
