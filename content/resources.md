## Data Sets & Data Work 💾

The Center for Digital Humanities publishes datasets through research partnerships and curation grants. [They can be viewed here](https://cdh.princeton.edu/research/data-curation/datasets/). The CDH also curates a list of [Humanities Datasets in Context](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IBORIU3yMiD240Ivc1fQpGSbKz_L4SOom1ntYlHHGKU/edit?usp=sharing), organized by discipline and annotated with information about data format and collection practices.

## Examples of Humanities Research Using AI & ML 🧪

DeepMind's [Ithaca](https://github.com/deepmind/ithaca), a project using AI to restore and attribute texts from Ancient Greece using neural networks as an aid to epigraphy.

MIT researchers using AI to [decode the still-undeciphered Indus script](https://restofworld.org/2022/indus-translation-ai-code-script/). The paper [published in *Science*](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1170391) concludes that the script is likely not just symbols, but language.

[AEOLIAN (Artificial Intelligence for Cultural Organisations)](https://www.aeolian-network.net/), including [this writeup](https://www.aeolian-network.net/case-study-2-computer-vision-and-cultural-heritage/) on use of AI with medieval manuscripts.
